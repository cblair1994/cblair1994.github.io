		The book for this month is <i>The Host</i> written by Stephenie Meyer.</p>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>
		"Melanie Stryder refuses to fade away. The earth has been invaded by a species 
		that take over the minds of their human hosts while leaving their bodies intact, and most of humanity has succumbed.
		<br><br>
		Wanderer, the invading "soul" who has been given Melanie's body, knew about the challenges of living inside a human: 
		the overwhelming emotions, the too vivid memories. But there was one difficulty Wanderer didn't expect: the former 
		tenant of her body refusing to relinquish possession of her mind.
		<br><br>
		Melanie fills Wanderer's thoughts with visions of the man Melanie loves-Jared, a human who still lives in hiding. 
		Unable to separate herself from her body's desires, Wanderer yearns for a man she's never met. As outside forces 
		make Wanderer and Melanie unwilling allies, they set off to search for the man they both love.
		<br><br>
		Featuring what may be the first love triangle involving only two bodies, THE HOST is a riveting 
		and unforgettable novel that will bring a vast new readership to one of the most compelling writers of our time."(amazon.com)

	<h3>Thoughts</h3>
	<p>
		I really enjoyed this book. We got to see a different side of Stephenie Meyer than what we read in her Twilight series.
		The charactor development was great and the details of the underground compound was wonderful. I was able to read this
		book in a day, I just could not put it down.
